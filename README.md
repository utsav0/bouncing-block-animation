# bouncing-block-animation

So, this is a simple animation made only using Vanilla CSS where 5 cuboidal blocks are bouncig with a ball in 3D.

To use this animation, you don't need any special thing it'll work well even in a simple code editor
and this project don't have any special use case but you can use this design wherever you want.

I made this project open source only because I wanted to learn about it. But still, all the improvements are most welcome.
